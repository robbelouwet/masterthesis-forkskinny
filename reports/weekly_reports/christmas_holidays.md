## Report Christmas holidays

### Tuesday 27 dec

I got my hands on an Arduino Sense BLE 33 a few weeks ago, it has a Cortex M4 chip with a special register keeping score
of the current cycle count. Managed to set up PlatformIO IDE in VS Code, so I can write code in vanilla C++ instead of
the over simplified arduino IDE. Also managed to find a code snippet to actually poll the cycle count, seems to work.
