## Weekly report 27 february - 05 march

# Tuesday

It works! Can correctly compute a forkskinny64-192 block encryption with correct output (verified with Erik's
implementation). Normally, fs64-64, fs64-128 should also work in s=b mode, but haven't tested yet, this is for tomorrow.
Tomorrow:
- code cleanup: get rif of debug-related code and statements, unnecessary comments
- optimize: get rid of loops and see what else can be optimized
- decryption: implement all reverse operations
