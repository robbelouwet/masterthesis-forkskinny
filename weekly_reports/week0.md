## Weekly report 03 - 09 october
- Started researching which papers are relevant to the topic, and which ones to read. I read the first parts on the 'TWEAKEY Framework' and the 'SKINNY Family of Blockciphers', but realized it required background knowledge I didn't have. I backtracked to make a 'dependency graph' to know the order of the papers to read, and started reading. The first one on the list was 'Tweakable Blockciphers', which I read.
- Watched a video of Dan Boneh on the decisional game of tweakable blockciphers, I noted this challenger <-> adversary sketch but had some questions.
- Meeting with Elena

### What was on my mind
- What are my short- and longterm goals? E.g.: what will I try to achieve before end of november?
- How do these goals translate to the faculty's intermediate deadlines in december and april?
- How much hours/week to spend on master thesis -> faculty says 15 hrs: monday, wednesday and thursday before noon 5 hours
- What's the exact scope of the theses, what is the official 'research question' I need to answer in my theses?
- How will communication go with supervisors throughout the year?
