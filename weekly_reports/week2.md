## Weekly report 17 - 23 october
### Monday
Migrated the github repo into the KUL gitlab repo I was provided from my faculty and invited Elena and Amit. 
Fixed up the structure of this repository, was struggling with getting the git submodules right.
Cloning with `--recurse-submodules` now clones the external repos as well.


### What was on my mind
- Can we migrate the SKINNY+ implementation from rweather's Romelus cipher into Erik's ForkSkinny implementation to get practically free speedups?
